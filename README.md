MED2023-Improved Dynamic Event-Triggered Consensus Control for Multi-Agent Systems with Designable Inter-Event Time

All simulations were carried out using MATLAB R2022b on a PC running Windows 11 with an AMD R7-6800H CPU and 16 GB RAM. Random seeds are set to default in MATLAB. The LMI optimisation problems were solved using YALMIP (2021 version) with the solver SeDuMi 1.3.5.
