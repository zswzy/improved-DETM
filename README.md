MED2023-Improved Dynamic Event-Triggered Consensus Control for Multi-Agent Systems with Designable Inter-Event Time

All simulations were carried out using MATLAB R2023a and Simulink on a workstation running Ubuntu 22.04 with an Intel i7-12700 CPU and 32 GB RAM. For the Python-based experiments, we used Python 3.10 with PyTorch 2.0 and CUDA 12.1. Random seeds were fixed across all runs. Detailed documentation is included in the repository to enable replication of the reported results.
